# VISUALIZER
The Sorting Visualizer project is basically a web based project which is used to
visualize the sorting algorithms and performs the operation of algorithms step by
step as the algorithms works like Bubble Sort, selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge
Sort, Quick Sort etc. We shuffle the bars in the random order that is in an unsorted
order. We perform sorting algorithms on these bars to sort these bars in a ascending
order by applying the different algorithms by clicking on the buttons of these
sorting algorithms.


# Feature of Sorting Visualizer.
* Select algorithms: we can select five different type of sorting algorithm
for visualize.
* Shuffle: By clicking generate button we can regenerate our bar element.
* Bar Size Control: We can control our bar size (number of array element) by
size slider.
* Control speed: we can control our speed by speed slider.
* Play and reset: By clicking play and reset button we can start and
reset visualization.
* Sorting Area: In The Sorting Area we can show the Visualization.
* Algorithms Description: Here we can see corresponding selected Algorithm
Description.
* Complexity: Here we can see corresponding selected algorithms complexity.
